## Basic Overview

I have a strong value for team management and organization. Applications like JIRA and Trello have inspired me to develop my own project management application.
This is the JavaFX desktop version of Clipboard.
Users can create new projects, teams, and assign tasks in a smooth and user-friendly process.
